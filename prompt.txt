Considera queste variabili:
- item
- lenght
- model
- material (no, voglio che mi generi una lista di materiali dopo)
- color / pattern
- event
- stile


## FOR IMAGE GENERATION

#### Works pretty well on ImageFX  -- not on copilot. It does not generate sketches, but final product
I am a stylist and i want you to help me develping some sketches. Keeping always the same drawing style, generate only the sketch for  a {style} {color} {item} {pattern} - do not generate the final product, just a draft on a neutral background that seems hand drawn and be sure that there is only one sketch per page. Imagine a {lenght} {item} , with {model - fit} , that is suitable for a {event}. The {item} is meant to be worn by a {gender}.

EXAMPLE
I am a stylist and i want you to help me develping some sketches. Keeping always the same drawing style, generate only the sketch for  a classy white jacket - do not generate the final product, just a draft on a neutral background that seems hand drawn and be sure that there is only one sketch per page. Imagine a long sleeve jacket , with relaxed fit, that is suitable for a  conference. The jacket is meant to be worn by a woman.


## FOR DESCRIPTION GENERATION -- on CHATGPT
Consider the following text "prompt for image generation". 
Imagine the final product and give me a description of the item, without mentioning the material, that can be used as a caption for the product. It should be a brief description, with some technical details. The generated text must not include anything apart from the caption, so no title, no bullet points and no fancy adjective. 



## FOR OBTAINING LIST OF MATERIALS -- on CHATGPT
Consider the following text "previous prompt". 
Propose a list of 6 possible materials that are suitable for producing the item and return just the name of the materials, without titles or explanations.


## OBTAIN DESCRIPTION OF PATTERNS -- on CHATGPT (do it for 3 times or make it generate three in a row)
# doing it once is okay, since the model generates different output
Given this text "prompt for image generation" can you give me a textual description (no bullet point) of a pattern that uses {color} can be used for the fabric of the item?
The output must be only the description of the pattern, avoid any additional text

## OBTAIN PATTERNS -- on ImageFX
Create a pattern for fabric having the following features "prompt_pattern1".
